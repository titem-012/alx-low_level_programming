Debugging
Rubber Duck Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.



Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is debugging
What are some methods of debugging manually
How to read the error messages
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

Tasks
0. Multiple mains
mandatory
Score: 0.0% (Checks completed: 0.0%)
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.h
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

#include <stdio.h>

void positive_or_negative(int i);

#endif /* MAIN_H */
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ 
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c main.c
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./a.out
98 is positive
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./0-main
0 is zero
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 1-main.c

1. Like, comment, subscribe
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)
        {
                putchar(i);
        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
Your output should look like this:

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ gcc -std=gnu89 1-main.c -o 1-main
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ ./1-main
Infinite loop incoming :(
Infinite loop avoided! \o/
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ wc -l 1-main.c

2. 0 > 972?
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
This program prints the largest of three integers.

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 2-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints the largest of 3 integers
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
int a, b, c;
int largest;

a = 972;
b = -98;
c = 0;

largest = largest_number(a, b, c);

printf("%d is the largest number\n", largest);

return (0);
}
